No one can guarantee that. However we give you a huge advantage by giving you everything you see in the “On-Watch” section. Also when it comes to ACOs(Slots) we have a high success rate of getting items for members and showing them our secrets so they can do it them selves as well.

We innovate and stride to always be one step ahead of the competition. We have things in the group such as backdoors, raffles, slots, free bot rentals, and more which you won’t find in many groups. Our team of experts has had more success than most people in the industry with millions of dollars made. We know what we’re doing and we don’t hold anything back from our members.
